## ⚙️ Setup & Activation Steps

> ⚠️ *Star Citizen bans are account-wide. Always use alt accounts to test hacks before going full send.*

### Step-by-Step:

1. Start Star Citizen launcher & load into the universe
2. Run cheat injector (before ship select)
3. Press hotkey (INSERT/F9) to bring up cheat menu
4. Toggle ESP (ships, players, cargo, loot), Aimbot (FPS mode), Radar, or Mining auto
5. Fly, loot, fight — win every encounter

## 🔐 Anti-Cheat & Risk

Star Citizen uses **behavior-based tracking** and **manual reporting** over traditional anti-cheat software.
Cheats that are:

* **External**
* **Overlay-based**
* **Scripted instead of memory editing**
  …are more stealthy.

Avoid rage-hacking in high-pop hubs like Area18 or Orison. Don’t teleport or kill players in obvious ways.
